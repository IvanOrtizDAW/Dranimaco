Your potential customers are visiting your WordPress website right now, but there’s a lower chance they’ll buy from you if they’re not engaged. After 1-minute installation, a Tidio Live Chat widget appears on your website and lets your customers get real-time personal help by answering questions and resolving their doubts. This directly results in more sales, higher customer satisfaction and bigger contacts’ list.

What if you’re not online or you’d like to engage your customers automatically for even more sales and generated leads? With ready-to-use chatbots you can send messages, collect emails and answer frequently asked questions - fully automatically. After that, you easily reach out to all your contacts with one of the ready-to-use email marketing templates available with built-in Tidio Email Marketing solution.

= How do I use Tidio Live Chat in WordPress? =

Right after you install, open the “Tidio Chat” tab, and you’re ready to go! A chat widget will be visible on your website, so your visitors can contact you in real-time. Once you access the Tidio dashboard, you can reply to any incoming chats, configure Chatbots, send email marketing campaigns, and manage other settings.
